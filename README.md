# üìä Amazon Sales Analysis using Python

## üí° Project Summary

Performed **data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization** on Amazon‚Äôs sales dataset to uncover insights on **sales performance, customer behavior, fulfillment efficiency, product demand, and geographical distribution**. The project highlights trends, bottlenecks, and growth opportunities to **optimize sales strategies and improve customer satisfaction**.

---

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Amazon handles millions of sales transactions across multiple categories, fulfillment methods, and regions. However, raw sales data often comes with challenges such as:

* Missing or inconsistent values
* High variation in customer behavior across geographies
* Lack of structured insights into sales performance, fulfillment, and product demand

The goal was to **analyze sales trends, customer segments, and geographical performance** to generate **actionable business insights**.

## üìÇ Dataset

* **File:** `Cleaned_Amazon_Sale_Report.csv`
* **Key Fields:**

  * `Order ID`, `Date`, `Amount`, `Category`, `Size`, `Qty`, `Fulfilment`, `ship-state`, `ship-city`, `Status`

---

## üõ† Tools & Technologies

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation & Cleaning

* Handled missing values and duplicates
* Converted data types (e.g., dates, numerical fields)
* Removed invalid/irrelevant records

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Analysis

* **Sales Overview:** Monthly revenue trends, order distribution, AOV (Average Order Value)
* **Product Analysis:** Popular categories, product sizes, revenue by category
* **Fulfillment Analysis:** Delivery status by fulfillment method, order counts, AOV by fulfillment type
* **Customer Segmentation:** Orders and spending by top cities/states
* **Geographical Analysis:** State & city-level contribution to sales and orders

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization

* Bar charts for **top products, categories, and cities**
* Pie chart for **sales share across states**
* Line plots for **monthly sales trends**
* Scatter plots for **orders vs sales (city-wise)**

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Business Insights

* Seasonal peaks in sales (promotional/holiday-driven demand)
* High concentration of orders in **metro states & cities**
* Returns & cancellations impacting customer experience
* Strong correlation between **order frequency and total spend**

---

## üîç Key Insights

‚úî Maharashtra & Karnataka drive the highest revenue, led by metro cities like **Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Hyderabad**
‚úî Bengaluru has **high order frequency**, while Hyderabad shows **higher AOV** ‚Üí different customer behaviors
‚úî Certain months show clear **sales peaks** (likely festivals/promotions)
‚úî **Majority of orders are successful**, but cancellations/returns still impact customer trust
‚úî Product demand is **uneven across categories**, with a few categories dominating sales

---

## üìä Outputs

* Cleaned and structured sales dataset
* Visualizations:

  * Top states & cities by sales
  * Monthly revenue trends
  * Order status distribution
  * Product category breakdown
  * Scatterplot of orders vs revenue
* Business insights report (PDF/Markdown)
